## This repository creates a basic structure for shiny app.

### To create a shiny app in the current directory within R console:
`source("create_shiny_app.R")`

### To run the shiny app within R console, go to the app directory and execute the line given below:
`source("run.R")`

### Shiny App Directory Structure generated by create_shiny_app.R
```
└───first-app                 -- Name of the shiny app directory
    │   global.R              -- file to hold all global variables
    │   run.R                 -- call this file to run the shiny app: source("run.R")
    │   server.R              -- server side codes are kept in this file
    │   ui.R                  -- client or user interface codes are kept in this file
    └───data/                 -- directory to hold datasets for the shiny app
```
### Shiny App
After running this app, it pulls the value of `name` global variable which is defined in global.R and greets you with that name.
